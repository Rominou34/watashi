# Watashi

## What is this ?

It's a simple static webpage written in HTML displaying some informations about your server

## How do I use it ?

Just `git clone` the repo and change the values of the server details inside the HTML ( as it's static, you directly have to modify the HTML )

## What's the point ?

As I run multiple servers I name them after anime girls ( Mai, Mugi, etc. ) and each server has its subdomain displaying information about it ( [mai.rominou.moe](http://mai.rominou.moe), [mugi.rominou.moe](https://mugi.rominou.moe), etc. )
